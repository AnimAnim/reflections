What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	you create a hidden .git file that git will track the repository with. Needed for git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It holds what will be added to the next commit rather than the directory the .git is in or what git is recording.
	It helps with changing what part of the we is consider part of the repository
